# Frontend (Vite + React) â€” README

## Setup
1. Node.js (v16+) installed.
2. From `frontend/`:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev`

This frontend expects the backend at `http://localhost:5000`. For CORS reasons, the backend allows requests from anywhere (development only).

Notes:
- Tailwind is included via CDN for quick prototyping. For production, set up PostCSS/Tailwind properly (see Tailwind docs).
