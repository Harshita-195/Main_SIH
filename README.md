# Digital Guidance Platform â€” MVP (Full-stack template)

This repository contains a lightweight **MVP** for a Digital Guidance Platform (web + backend).
It provides:
- A simple Express backend that serves APIs for colleges, quizzes, and timelines (JSON files).
- A minimal React frontend that consumes those APIs and demonstrates:
  - Quiz flow (aptitude & interest)
  - Nearby government colleges directory (static JSON)
  - Dashboard and timeline placeholders

This ZIP is intended as a starter template. Follow backend/frontend README sections for run instructions.
